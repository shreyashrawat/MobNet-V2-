# MobNet-V2-
Multi-class image classification 

This repository compares multi-class image classification problem between a created custom model and a pretrained MobNet V2 model.

# Custom Model

The model consisted of 3 CNN layers and various different hyper parameter tuning was tried. The best accuracy, the model could get to was 72% on train set and 62% on test set. You can get the train accuracy of upto 90% by changing the optimizer to Adam but the test accuracy falttens at 55% which is a clear sign of overfitting.
